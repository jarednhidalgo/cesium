This is a project for personal purposes. I'd be grateful if you point out errors in relation to the goal below.

Goal: To show a 1x1 meter rectangle using a quaternion and Cesium software. A quaternion is a 4-dimensional equation to rotate an object in 3D. The rectangle can be placed anywhere on Earth using longitude, latitude, and height. The quaternion is controlled by heading, pitch, and roll.

Usage: You may use this code as if you were using Cesium normally. My edits are all in the index.html file and the texture is a JPG file in the same directory as the HTML file.
