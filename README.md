This is a project for personal purposes. I'd be grateful if you point out errors in relation to the goal below.

Goal: To show a 1x1 meter rectangle using a quaternion and Cesium software. A quaternion is a 4-dimensional equation to set the orientation of a object in 3D. The rectangle can be placed anywhere on Earth using longitude, latitude, and height. The quaternion is controlled by heading, pitch, and roll.

Usage: You may use this code as if you were using Cesium normally. To use Cesium, I made a new ASP.NET web app in Visual Studio, downloaded the Cesium code, and put it in the top directory.

Changes: All of the additions and changes I made to the Cesium code include the index.html, LICENSE.md, README.md, CHANGES.md, and qsys-sydney-sand.jpg files. The picture is a texture for the rectangle.
